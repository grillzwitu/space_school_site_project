1
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,189
it's Norm from Tested calm and I'm here
at the neutral buoyancy lab NASA's

2
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,390
neutral buoyancy lab in Houston Texas
this is where NASA trains astronauts

3
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,119
before they can go to space and hero
Terry done you're the training

4
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,460
Operations Manager and Terry we're in
front of a spacesuit right this is the

5
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,170
extra vehicular Mobility unit or EMU as
we call it and it's the spacesuits that

6
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,610
astronauts wear for spacewalks either
the Space Shuttle back in those days or

7
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,570
the space station now and so this is the
news this is the design that's been used

8
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,829
for decades right it's essentially
unchanged for the past 40 years now

9
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,670
we've seen what the spacesuit kind of
looks like you know in photos and videos

10
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,780
but we don't really know what goes
underneath and how an astronaut she puts

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,719
on the suit can you show us the
different components of a spacesuit and

12
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,780
all the various different accessories
that they put on

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,020
well sure this is really just the outer
layer and it starts with a few things

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,220
that we have over here now on this table
we have the components to go inside of

15
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,280
the suit starting with the diaper
underwear in space oh but it's a diaper

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,530
right and it's big enough for an adult
but it's the same purpose and ideally

17
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,960
you're not going to have to use it but
in reality you're going to be in that

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,158
suit about six hours so and this is only
worn when you're in going to wear a

19
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,520
spacesuit right and now when you're just
flown around the ISS up to that right

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,420
personal preference I suppose but when
you got to go you got to go no over the

21
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,479
diaper you're going to have basically
off-the-shelf cotton long johns

22
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,009
alright so mine is fine right and the
idea is that it's going to wick away any

23
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,310
sweat that you have in there so that
your body doesn't get slippery and

24
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,340
you're not going to puddle sweat at the
bottom of the suit so you would have the

25
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,159
pants and then also a long-sleeve shirt
that would go over that sounds good

26
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,340
sounds like everything I could buy at a
supermarket right now right so far

27
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,820
you're good be happy you're ready to go
into space next you're going to get

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,750
derailed a little bit this is the liquid
cooled ventilation garment and basically

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,410
it's a jumpsuit with very stretchy
material but woven in through that

30
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,450
material are tubes
on cold water so by varying the flow

31
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,660
rate of that cold water you can manage
your body temperature you can imagine

32
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,299
with all this stuff underneath and then
all the stuff you're going to put on the

33
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,080
outside you get hot very quickly
especially if you're working outside and

34
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,680
so it's just through these tubes here
and and it's designed so those are the

35
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,390
points where heat can be can be release
more effectively right it's distributed

36
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,750
well enough that you don't feel point
cooling it's it's basically an overall

37
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,680
effect okay and then we've got the
communication cap and this is really

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,920
kind of a NASA trademark this is the
Snoopy cap that ya read about forever

39
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,369
and OH

40
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,260
so if you'd like you may try it on I
will Wow all right so this plugs in Vani

41
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,040
this will plug into a port on the suit
and then you've got electrical power and

42
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,340
there's a radio built in that lets you
talk to the guys back inside the space

43
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,590
station and indirectly back down to
Mission Control we would also have a few

44
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,730
other ancillary items that are kind of
at the discretion of the astronaut

45
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,530
they'll be wearing cotton gloves that go
underneath the regular gloves and again

46
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,170
it's the same idea is the undergarments
you're just going to want to wick away

47
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,820
the sweat underneath and then we also
have a variety of pads and shields that

48
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,690
help limit any contact with the metal
inside the suit so you don't get soft

49
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,590
spots and bruising while you're in there
this would be an example of those all

50
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,970
right and then after they put all this
on they put on the EMU right the outer

51
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,650
part of the suit all right let's go
check that out since we're here at the

52
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,640
NBL these suits are used for training
purposes how does this suit differ than

53
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,570
what the astronauts actually wear ISS
well if you take away the life-support

54
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,630
system which is the backpack looking
thing appear there's really no

55
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,980
difference in fact a lot of the hardware
that we use here for training is

56
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,220
hardware that's flown in space before
been in space and repurposed as training

57
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,459
right I like to think it's been upgraded
for training but they call it

58
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,240
downgrading for training an astronaut
would have to disassemble it from it

59
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,000
hanging on a wall for putting it on
right they would want to break it down

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,910
into the same components like we have
here and what do they put on first um

61
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,540
the first thing you're going to do is
put on the lower torso assembly which to

62
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,570
you and me would be a pair of pants with
the shoes built in they call it space

63
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,500
walking but you don't use your legs a
whole lot of space working so they would

64
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,430
put this on and it gets pulled out to
about their waist once they've got that

65
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,620
they're going to waddle underneath this
like in space it's not waddling

66
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,310
going to float underneath here and then
squat through the bottom of this upper

67
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,820
torso assembly which is rigidly mounted
to the inside of the space station and

68
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,000
then get their arms up through here and
their head will pop out of the top and

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,340
then at that point they're in the suit
and this is a very rigid suit like a

70
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,419
does not lie mobility in here right the
upper part that they're called the heart

71
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,530
upper torso for a reason it's really a
hard shell and despite the obvious

72
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,099
comfort level of that there's a reason
for it and you've got to have all these

73
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,130
different things a life support system
the controls for the suit your tools all

74
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,669
have to be rigidly mounted so you need
that hard shell to be able to do that

75
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,659
what are the materials that are used for
the EMU it's many different materials

76
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,350
and layers I imagine right there's a few
different composites that I can't

77
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,130
explain all the details of a secret
right the different composites that make

78
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,490
up the hard upper part and then several
layers of materials that make up the

79
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,350
bladder part as well so they have the
upper unit and then what's next they're

80
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,539
going to button these two pieces
together and they'll have an assistant

81
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,349
that helps them do that the bottom part
is attached to the upper part here and

82
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:32,320
then they'll put on gloves and I've got
one here if you'd like to try that uh no

83
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:40,000
yeah there's lace right handed it's a
very very tight fit there and the gloves

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,820
are the customized some extent a to a
degree

85
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,169
um these components the lower torso or
something the harder part or so you

86
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:50,590
really get small medium and large and
you get the best fit within that for the

87
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,940
gloves we've got dozens of different
sizes so while we don't necessarily make

88
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,199
custom gloves for every person there's a
variation that we get pretty close with

89
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,660
just about everybody yeah and what's
important feature of the glove you know

90
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,500
in terms of usability functionality and
safety there's a fine line between the

91
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,389
dexterity that they have to be able to
do a job and the comfort of the fit so

92
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:17,349
my opinion and I'm sure a lot of people
would disagree is that a little bit of

93
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:20,949
pain is just right that means you're
getting the best dexterity you can out

94
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,849
of that glove if it's too comfortable
you're probably missing a little bit of

95
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:29,020
the nuance of being able to work so if
you're to get it sort of screw a hundred

96
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,070
times right you don't want the glove in
your way and then both gloves on and

97
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,590
finally the helmet then right then the
helmet

98
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,919
all right oh it's very echoing here
right now when you're really in the suit

99
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,890
you've got the air flowing through
you're probably not going to notice that

100
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,700
you've got a lot of materials in there
that would damp that sound and with the

101
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,840
helmet on the helmet hasn't turned when
vastra nods head turns that's right your

102
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,099
field of view is very limited so is your
situational awareness and so you can

103
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,640
basically look almost all the way to
your right and left and then you need to

104
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,719
look people look down as well correct so
if you need to see beyond those views

105
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,760
you're turning your whole torso like
you're in traction to be able to do that

106
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,980
now you're right here there's a knob
twist that forward and that's the visor

107
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,220
right there's also one by your left ear

108
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:29,560
that would be more of a shield to keep
direct Sun away from you and when you're

109
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,410
in space you don't have the atmosphere
kind of filtering out the light the

110
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,610
sunlight is very bright and what
material is this visor made out no

111
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:43,090
that's just regular probably carbonate
looks and plastic very very cool well

112
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,140
that's the anatomy of a spacesuit
attached to the spacesuit is life

113
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,219
support unit and different tools then
right on the back would be the life

114
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,970
support system and on the front would be
the tools that they use and that's all

115
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,550
stored in another lab all right well
let's go check those out as well all

116
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,670
right

117
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,910
okay Terry so these are the astronauts
tools it's a small selection they have

118
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,570
available yes this is what they would
use and this what is this device here

119
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,590
this is called the mini workstation and
this part would attach directly to that

120
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,008
hard upper torso that we were looking at
and plug right in right and you can

121
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:28,889
think of this as their tool belt
most of the stuff they'll use on any

122
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:32,250
given spacewalk they would try to store
it on here to keep it handy and they

123
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,669
could choose from a different selection
of tools on the space station before

124
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,400
they go on the spacewalk right they
would decide based on whatever tasks

125
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,010
they're going to do that time so give me
example of some of the tools they use

126
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,630
what we have here is a basic ratchet
wrench and it's a lot like the ratchet

127
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,560
wrench you would use at home it's a 3 H
Drive and the main difference is being

128
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,890
you've got a big wheel in the back so if
you're going to be in a tight space

129
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,920
operating this you don't want to have to
reach down and turn the socket like you

130
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,770
would at home you can get that glove and
put it on the background turn it that

131
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,319
way
and also you've got a nice big handle

132
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,230
down here that gives you plenty of
gripping strength and it's ridged

133
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,920
now another feature is they have a
cheater bar they can flip this into the

134
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,860
bottom you've got the same sort of
handle down here but now you've pretty

135
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,470
much doubled your moment arm so you can
really put a lot of torque on in

136
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,839
something and at this point you have to
be careful that you're not going to

137
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,410
break either the bolt or the head of the
socket wrench and so just turn the

138
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,709
socket in space it's different than
doing it on earth the socket is turning

139
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,949
you as much as you return the socket so
a lot of times it's going to be a

140
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,650
one-handed operation where you're going
to use one hand to stabilize yourself

141
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,339
while the other hand does the work or
you have the option of using a foot

142
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,430
restraint that would hold you in place
do all these tools help me tethered to

143
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,120
the astronaut at all times or it's okay
for them to happen for hand no they

144
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,750
never want to have it just relying on
their grip to keep it there so we have

145
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,890
these equipment tethers if they're doing
a job correctly any tool that they're

146
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,010
using is always going to be attached to
one of these others and then they wanted

147
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,180
to change out a head or a different
socket then they go this side right they

148
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,449
have a number of different sockets that
could choose from again depending on

149
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,540
what they want to do and there would be
stored on something like this we call a

150
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,890
socket caddy and so you have a pin you
would insert it into this hole in the

151
